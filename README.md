# Insurance Prediction by using a neural netowrk model using TensorFlow library.

# End-to-end neural network regression predictive modelling with TensorFlow

This notebook builds an end-to-end regressor using TensorFlow library.

## 1. Problem Definition

Predicting the medical insurance charges for a person given other feature variables.

## 3. Features

**Dataset information:**

We have the following columns: 

- **age**: age of primary beneficiary

- **sex**: insurance contractor gender, female, male

- **bmi**: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

- **children**: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

- **smoker**: Smoking

- **region**: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

- **charge**: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance
